# EnScrypt @enscrypt_version@

EnScrypt is an acceleration-resistant password hashing library and utility based on the memory-hard PBKDF Scrypt.

## Based On

* SQRL 
    * Author: Steve Gibson
    * [Author's Site](https://www.grc.com/)
    * [Algorithm Detail](https://www.grc.com/sqrl/scrypt.htm)
    * This software (EnScrypt) is an implementation of the EnScrypt algorithm that Steve designed for SQRL.

    * This is used for accurate cross-platform timing.

## Supported Platforms
This implementation is intended to work on multiple platforms.  Tested platforms include:
* Linux (Ubuntu 32 and 64 bit)
* Win32 (Tested on Windows 8.1 64 bit)
* Mac OS X (Tested on 10.9.2 64 bit)
* Android ARM
* Android ARM with NEON (optimized implementation with runtime detection of NEON support and fallback)

Compiles, but has not been thoroughly tested on:
* Android X86
* Android MIPS

Planned, but not yet supported:
* iOS

## Building and Installing
See the BUILDING.md file for build instructions.

## Using the command line utility
The command line utility is substantially similar to Steve Gibson's [reference implementation](https://www.grc.com/sqrl/scrypt.htm).  Normal use is almost identical:

```
enscrypt [-q] [password] [salt] [iteration_count | duration]
```

All arguments are optional, and order is arbitrary.  This implementation adds the "-q" and "-h" options.

* duration: An integer + 's' or 'S'.  For example, "5s" == 5 seconds.
* iteration_count: An integer + 'i' or 'I'.  For example, "100i" == 100 iterations.
* salt: a 64 character hex string representing a 32 byte salt.  Allowed characters are 0-9, a-f, and A-F.
* -q: Quiet.  Suppresses all output except the computed output key.
* -h: Help.  Displays usage information.
* password: any string not matching the above arguments.

## Using the library
Documentation is available in the enscrypt.h header, or in HTML in the doc directory.

### Basic Use
Typically, you'll just need two functions from the library, enscrypt() and enscrypt_ms().  They look like this:

```
int enscrypt(uint8_t *buf, const char *passwd, const uint8_t *salt, int iterations, enscrypt_progress_fn cb_ptr );
int enscrypt_ms( uint8_t *buf, const char *passwd, const uint8_t *salt, int millis, enscrypt_progress_fn cb_ptr );
```

To run 100 iterations:
```
#include <enscrypt.h>

int main()
{
  int time_elapsed;
  uint8_t buf[32];
  uint8_t salt[32] = {0};
  
  time_elapsed = enscrypt( buf, "password", salt, 100, 9, NULL, NULL );
}
```

Or, to run for 5 seconds:
```
#include <enscrypt.h>

int main()
{
  int iteration_count;
  uint8_t buf[32];
  uint8_t salt[32] = {0};
  
  iteration_count = enscrypt_ms( buf, "password", salt, 5000, 9, NULL, NULL );
}
```

To use a callback function to monitor progress:
```
#include <enscrypt.h>

void progress_fn( int progress )
{
  printf( "%d%%\n", progress );
}

int main()
{
  uint8_t buf[32];
  
  enscrypt( buf, NULL, NULL, 100, 9, progress_fn, NULL );
}
```

### Advanced use
See the documentation in enscrypt.h for more details on each:

* enscrypt_progress_fn - progress callback prototype.
* enscrypt_fatal_errorfn - fatal error function prototype.
* enscrypt_get_real_time() - Get a value representing execution time.
* enscrypt_set_fatal_error() - Set a function to call in the event of an un-recoverable error.
